.SH NAME
_printf \- reimplementation of printf function that formats and writes output to standard output

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.br
.B int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
_printf formats and writes a sequence of characters to stdout according to the
argument format string. It is a custom reimplementation intended to behave
similarly to the standard C library printf(3) for the supported conversion
specifiers. The function parses the format string, consumes any additional
arguments, and writes the resulting characters to standard output.

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
format
A null-terminated format string containing plain characters and conversion
specifiers. Conversion specifiers begin with '%' and are replaced by formatted
representations of the corresponding arguments.
.TP
...
An indeterminate number of additional arguments (of types determined by the
conversion specifiers in format).

.SH SUPPORTED CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
The available conversion specifiers and their expected argument types
include:
.IP "\fB%c\fR"
int, printed as a single character.
.IP "\fB%s\fR"
char *, printed as a null-terminated string.
.IP "\fB%d\fR, \fB%i\fR"
int, printed as signed decimal.
.IP "\fB%u\fR"
unsigned int, printed as unsigned decimal.
.IP "\fB%o\fR"
unsigned int, printed as unsigned octal.
.IP "\fB%x\fR, \fB%X\fR"
unsigned int, printed as unsigned hexadecimal (lower/upper case).
.IP "\fB%p\fR"
void *, printed as an implementation-defined pointer representation.
.IP "\fB%%\fR"
A literal percent sign; no argument consumed.

Note: Additional specifiers may be provided by a particular
implementation. Consult the implementation header/comments for exact support.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, _printf returns the number of characters printed (excluding the
terminating null byte used internally). On failure, a negative value is
returned.

.SH ERRORS
If a format specifier does not match the type of the corresponding argument,
or if the format string is malformed, the behavior is undefined. Implementations
may return a negative value on write errors to stdout.

.SH EXAMPLES
Here is a simple example of usage:
.nf
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
    int n;
    n = _printf("Hello, %s! You have %d new Holberton tasks.\n", "Jojo", 5);
    /* n now holds the number of characters written */
    return (n < 0);
}
.fi

.SH PORTABILITY AND NOTES
This function is reimplementation with the purpose of learning and is not guaranteed
to provide all features, flags, field width or precision behavior of the system printf.
When portability or full C standard compliance is required, use the standard
printf(3) provided by the C library.
